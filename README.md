Compare two objects using accessed properties with Proxy

## Introduction

This is an internal library used in [React Tracked](https://react-tracked.js.org).

## Install

```bash
npm install proxy-compare
```

## Usage

```javascript
$ node
> const { createDeepProxy, isDeepChanged } = require('proxy-compare')
undefined
> state = { a: 1, b: 2 }
{ a: 1, b: 2 }
> affected = new WeakMap()
WeakMap { [items unknown] }
> proxy = createDeepProxy(state, affected)
Proxy [ { a: 1, b: 2 },
  { r: [Function],
    u: [Function],
    get: [Function],
    has: [Function],
    ownKeys: [Function],
    p: Proxy [ [Object], [Circular] ],
    o: { a: 1, b: 2 },
    t: false,
    a: WeakMap { [items unknown] },
    c: undefined } ]
> proxy.a
1
> isDeepChanged(state, { a: 1, b: 22 }, affected)
false
> isDeepChanged(state, { a: 11, b: 2 }, affected)
true
```

### createDeepProxy

Create a proxy.

This function will create a proxy at top level and proxy nested objects as you access them,
in order to keep track of which properties were accessed via get/has proxy handlers:

NOTE: Printing of WeakMap is hard to inspect and not very readable
for this purpose you can use the `affectedToPathList` helper.

#### Parameters

-   `obj` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** Object that will be wrapped on the proxy.
-   `affected` **[WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)&lt;[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), unknown>** WeakMap that will hold the tracking of which properties in the proxied object were accessed.
-   `proxyCache` **[WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)&lt;[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), unknown>?** WeakMap that will help keep referential identity for proxies.

#### Examples

```javascript
import { createDeepProxy } from 'proxy-compare';

const orginal = { a: "1", c: "2", d: { e: "3" } };
const affected = new WeakMap();
const proxy = createDeepProxy(orginal, affected);

proxy.a // Will mark as used and track its value.
// This will update the affected WeakMap with orginal as key
// and a Set with "a"

proxy.d // Will mark "d" as accessed to track and proxy itself ({ e: "3" }).
// This will update the affected WeakMap with orginal as key
// and a Set with "d"
```

Returns **[Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)&lt;[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)>** Object wrapped in a proxy.

### isDeepChanged

Compare changes on objects.

This will compare the affected properties on tracked objects inside the proxy
to check if there were any changes made to it,
by default if no property was accessed on the proxy it will attempt to do a
reference equality check for the objects provided (Object.is(a, b)). If you access a property
on the proxy, then isDeepChanged will only compare the affected properties.

#### Parameters

-   `origObj` **any** 
-   `nextObj` **any** 
-   `affected` **[WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)&lt;[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), unknown>** WeakMap that holds the tracking of which properties in the proxied object were accessed.
-   `cache` **[WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)&lt;[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), unknown>?** WeakMap that holds a cache of the comparisons for better performance with repetitive comparisons,
    and to avoid infinite loop with circular structures.
-   `mode`   (optional, default `0`)
-   `obj` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** The original object to compare.
-   `obj` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** Object to compare with the original one.

#### Examples

```javascript
import { createDeepProxy, isDeepChanged } from 'proxy-compare';

const orginal = { a: "1", c: "2", d: { e: "3" } };
const affected = new WeakMap();

const proxy = createDeepProxy(orginal, affected);

proxy.a

isDeepChanged(proxy, { a: "1" }, affected) // false

proxy.a = "2"

isDeepChanged(proxy, { a: "1" }, affected) // true
```

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Boolean indicating if the affected property on the object has changed.
